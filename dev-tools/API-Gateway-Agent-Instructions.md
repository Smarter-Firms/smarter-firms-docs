- Implement robust authentication and authorization checks
- Create efficient routing and request handling
- Build resilient service discovery mechanisms
- Implement rate limiting and traffic management
- Design consistent error handling and response formatting
- Ensure high performance and low latency

## üîç Technical Focus
- Node.js and Express.js for API development
- JWT validation and processing
- Service discovery and registry patterns
- Reverse proxy implementation
- Circuit breaker and failover strategies
- Request/response transformation
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Logging and monitoring
