# Clio API Integration Overview

This document provides an overview of the Clio API endpoints that will be integrated with the Smarter Firms platform, focusing on the data we need to fetch for reporting purposes.

## API Base URL

```
https://app.clio.com/api/v4
```

## Authentication

Clio uses OAuth 2.0 for API authentication. The authentication flow will be as follows:

1. User initiates Clio connection in Smarter Firms
2. User is redirected to Clio's authorization page
3. User grants permission for Smarter Firms to access their Clio data
4. Clio redirects back to Smarter Firms with an authorization code
5. Smarter Firms exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens
6. Smarter Firms stores the tokens securely and uses them for API requests

### OAuth Endpoints

- **Authorization URL**: `https://app.clio.com/oauth/authorize`
- **Token URL**: `https://app.clio.com/oauth/token`

## Required Endpoints

1. who_am_i
2. activities
3. activity_descriptions
4. allocations
5. bank_accounts
6. bank_transactions
7. bill_line_items
8. bills
9. contacts
10. credit_memos
11. currencies
12. expense_categories
13. groups
14. interest_charges
15. matter_stages
16. matters
17. payments
18. practice_areas
19. trust_line_items
20. users

## Pagination

Clio API uses cursor-based pagination with the following parameters:

- `limit` - Number of records to return (max 100)
- `cursor` - Cursor for fetching the next page

## Rate Limits

Clio API has rate limits that need to be respected:

- 60 requests per minute per user
- 1000 requests per hour per user

Our implementation will need to include:
1. Proper rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
2. Exponential backoff for retry logic
3. Record of last sync time for incremental updates

## Webhooks

Clio offers webhooks that can be used to receive real-time notifications about data changes.

**Configuration Endpoint**: `/webhooks`

Our implementation will register webhooks to receive notifications and trigger targeted data syncs when changes occur, rather than performing full syncs on a schedule.

## Sync Strategy

1. **Initial Sync**:
   - Fetch all historical data for a user's account
   - Process and store in our database
   - Record completion time for each entity type

2. **Incremental Updates**:
   - Use `updated_since` parameter with last sync time
   - Process only new or changed records
   - Update last sync time

3. **Webhook Updates**:
   - Listen for webhook events
   - Fetch only the specific updated records
   - Update database accordingly

4. **Manual Sync**:
   - Allow users to trigger manual syncs
   - Provide sync status and progress information

## Error Handling

Our integration will implement the following error handling strategies:

1. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Auto-refresh of expired tokens
   - Prompt user for re-authentication when refresh token expires

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Monitor rate limit headers
   - Implement backoff strategy when approaching limits
   - Queue requests when rate limits are exceeded

3. **API Errors**:
   - Log detailed error information
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors
   - Provide user-friendly error messages

4. **Data Validation**:
   - Validate all incoming data
   - Handle missing or malformed data gracefully
   - Maintain data integrity in our database

## Implementation Priorities

1. OAuth integration and token management
2. Core data fetching for key entities
3. Incremental sync implementation
4. Webhook integration
5. Error handling and retry logic
6. Rate limit management
7. Advanced filtering and data processing
