# Auth Service Documentation Guidelines

## Key Documentation Responsibilities

Your team is responsible for maintaining:

1. **Authentication API Contracts** - Comprehensive OpenAPI specifications for all authentication endpoints
2. **JWT Structure** - Detailed documentation of JWT claims, validation, and lifecycle
3. **Security Implementations** - Documentation of security measures and best practices
4. **Integration Points** - How other services should integrate with authentication

## Critical Documents

- `/auth-service/api-contracts.yaml` - OpenAPI specification
- `/auth-service/jwt-implementation.md` - JWT structure and validation
- `/auth-service/security-measures.md` - Security implementations
- `/auth-service/integration-guide.md` - Guide for other services

## Update Frequency

Update documentation:
- Before implementing new features
- After making changes to API contracts
- When updating security measures
- When changing integration requirements

Your documentation is the primary reference for all other teams implementing authentication.
