# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the Notifications Service.

## Authentication and Authorization

### API Authentication

The Notifications Service uses JWT authentication for all API endpoints. Every request must include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

JWT tokens should:
- Be short-lived (max 1 hour expiration)
- Include appropriate scopes/permissions
- Be validated for signature, expiration, and issuer

### Permission Scopes

The service enforces the following permission scopes:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `notifications:read` | Read notification data and status |
| `notifications:write` | Create and update notifications |
| `notifications:admin` | Administrative actions (managing templates, channels) |

Example JWT payload:
```json
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "iss": "https://auth.smarter-firms.com",
  "exp": 1716144000,
  "iat": 1716140400,
  "scopes": ["notifications:read", "notifications:write"]
}
```

## Data Security

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. **Personal Information**: The service minimizes storing personal information:
   - Only stores user IDs, not profile data
   - Notification content is encrypted at rest
   - PII in templates is parameterized, not hardcoded

2. **Database Encryption**:
   - All database fields containing sensitive content use column-level encryption
   - Encryption keys are managed through secure key management solutions
   - Database backups are encrypted

3. **Data Retention**:
   - Notifications are kept for [retention period] days
   - Logs containing user identifiers are retained for [log retention] days
   - Historical data is anonymized after retention period

## Transport Security

1. **TLS Configuration**:
   - Minimum TLS version 1.2, preferring TLS 1.3
   - Strong cipher suites prioritized (e.g., ECDHE with AES-GCM)
   - HSTS headers enabled
   - Certificate pinning for backend services

2. **API Security Headers**:
   ```
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   ```

## Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**:
   - All API inputs validated using Zod schemas
   - Validation occurs before processing
   - Strict type checking enforced
   - Template variables sanitized before rendering

2. **Output Encoding**:
   - Content is properly escaped for the context (HTML, SQL, etc.)
   - Templates use context-aware encoding
   - Notification channels apply appropriate encoding

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors are logged with appropriate detail
   - Client responses exclude sensitive details
   - Stack traces never sent to clients
   - Error responses use consistent format

Example secure error response:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Unable to process request",
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "Invalid email format"
    }
  ],
  "requestId": "req-123456"
}
```

## Dependency Management

1. **Dependency Scanning**:
   - Regular automatic scanning for vulnerabilities
   - Integration with GitHub security alerts
   - SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) maintained
   - Manual reviews for critical dependencies

2. **Patching Policy**:
   - Critical vulnerabilities patched within 24 hours
   - High severity vulnerabilities patched within 7 days
   - Medium/Low severity vulnerabilities reviewed in sprint planning

3. **Dependency Pinning**:
   - Dependencies pinned to specific versions
   - Package lockfiles committed
   - Dependency updates reviewed before merging

## Audit Logging

1. **Events Logged**:
   - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
   - Authorization failures
   - Notification creation and delivery
   - Configuration changes
   - Template modifications

2. **Log Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2023-05-20T15:23:00.000Z",
     "level": "info",
     "event": "notification.sent",
     "requestId": "req-123456",
     "userId": "user123",
     "resource": "notifications",
     "action": "create",
     "status": "success",
     "metadata": {
       "notificationId": "notif-123",
       "channelType": "email",
       "templateId": "welcome-email"
     },
     "ip": "203.0.113.195",
     "userAgent": "ServiceClient/1.0"
   }
   ```

3. **Log Security**:
   - Logs centralized in secure storage
   - Log rotation and retention policies enforced
   - Access to logs restricted and audited
   - Integrity protection for logs

## Incident Response

1. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Abnormal notification patterns trigger alerts
   - Authentication failures monitored
   - Rate limit breaches logged and alerted
   - System health continuously monitored

2. **Response Process**:
   - Documented incident response plan
   - Security contacts and escalation paths defined
   - Ability to block suspicious IP addresses
   - Mechanisms to revoke compromised credentials

3. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - Rollback procedures documented
   - Backup restoration tested regularly
   - Alternative notification paths available
   - Communication templates for incidents

## Environment Security

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager
   - No secrets in code, config files, or environment variables
   - Secrets rotated regularly
   - Access to secrets audited

2. **Infrastructure Security**:
   - Services deployed in private subnets
   - Access restricted via security groups
   - Network traffic logged
   - Least privilege IAM roles

3. **Container Security**:
   - Container images scanned for vulnerabilities
   - Non-root users in containers
   - Read-only file systems where possible
   - Resource limits enforced

## Compliance Considerations

1. **Regulatory Requirements**:
   - GDPR: User consent tracked for marketing notifications
   - CCPA: Data subject access request support
   - Industry-specific regulations as applicable

2. **Privacy Controls**:
   - Privacy impact assessments for new features
   - Data minimization principles applied
   - Cross-border data transfer considerations
   - User preference management

3. **Documentation**:
   - Security controls documented
   - Regular security reviews conducted
   - Compliance certifications maintained
   - External audit support
