# AWS Credentials Request for Development Environment

## Overview

This document outlines the AWS credentials required for setting up the standardized development environment. These credentials will be used by the Infrastructure team to provision and configure necessary AWS resources for our microservices architecture.

## Timeline for Credential Provision

| Milestone | Required By | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Planning Phase | Phase 1, Day 3 | Initial access for architecture design |
| Infrastructure Setup | Phase 2, Day 1 | Core resource provisioning |
| Pipeline Configuration | Phase 2, Day 5 | CI/CD setup |
| Service Deployment | Phase 2, Day 10 | Initial service deployment |

## Required AWS Credentials

The following credentials should be provided to the Infrastructure team lead in a secure manner:

### 1. AWS Account Information

- **AWS Account ID**: The 12-digit account identifier
- **AWS Region**: Primary region for resource deployment (recommended: us-west-2)
- **Account Alias**: If applicable

### 2. IAM User with Administrative Access

- **Username**: Dedicated user for infrastructure provisioning
- **Access Key ID**: For programmatic access
- **Secret Access Key**: For programmatic access
- **Console Password**: For manual configuration (optional)

This user should have the following permissions:
- AdministratorAccess policy
- Ability to create IAM roles and policies
- Access to all services required for our architecture

### 3. Optional: Organization-Level Information

If we're using AWS Organizations:
- **Organization ID**: For resource organization
- **Parent OU**: Where the development account resides

## Credential Security Guidelines

When providing these credentials:

1. **Use a secure channel**: Credentials should be shared through a secure password manager or encrypted channel
2. **Avoid email**: Do not send credentials via email
3. **Time-limited access**: Consider providing temporary credentials if possible
4. **Revocation plan**: Have a plan for credential rotation or revocation after setup

## Responsibility and Usage

The Infrastructure team will use these credentials to:

1. Provision core infrastructure using Terraform or CloudFormation
2. Set up more granular service-specific roles with least-privilege permissions
3. Configure CI/CD pipelines with appropriate access
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

Once the initial setup is complete, the Infrastructure team will:

1. Create service-specific roles with limited permissions
2. Document all resources created
3. Set up budget alerts and resource tagging
4. Provide an access management plan for ongoing operations

## Next Steps

1. Please provide the requested credentials to the Infrastructure team lead by **Phase 1, Day 3**
2. Schedule a brief meeting to discuss any specific AWS account requirements or limitations
3. Infrastructure team will provide a detailed plan of resource provisioning for review
4. Regular updates will be provided on resource usage and any additional requirements
