## Dependencies and Relationships

- Auth Service is a prerequisite for all other services
- API Gateway depends on having at least one service to route to
- Clio Integration Service depends on Data Service for storing synchronized data
- Account & Billing Service depends on Auth Service for user accounts
- Notifications Service will be called by other services when events occur
