# UI-Service Standardization Tasks

## Overview

The UI-Service is responsible for extracting, packaging, and documenting our Tailwind CSS configuration as the single source of truth for styling across all microservices. This document outlines the specific tasks, technical approach, and timeline for implementation.

## Primary Objectives

1. Create a standalone Tailwind configuration package
2. Document component usage patterns for other services
3. Update the UI-Service to use this package
4. Provide integration examples for other services

## Technical Approach

### 1. Extract Tailwind Configuration

Create a new package called `@smarter-firms/tailwind-config` with the following structure:

```
@smarter-firms/tailwind-config/
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── index.js           # Main export for the tailwind config
├── theme/             # Theme-specific configurations
│   ├── colors.js      # Color palette definitions
│   ├── typography.js  # Typography scale
│   ├── spacing.js     # Spacing system
│   └── index.js       # Theme exports
├── plugins/           # Custom Tailwind plugins
├── components/        # Component-specific styles
└── examples/          # Integration examples
```

The main `index.js` should export a function that accepts overrides and merges them with the base configuration:

```javascript
// index.js
const colors = require('./theme/colors');
const typography = require('./theme/typography');
const spacing = require('./theme/spacing');

module.exports = function(overrides = {}) {
  return {
    content: [
      "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      // Allow services to specify their content
      ...(overrides.content || [])
    ],
    theme: {
      colors: colors,
      typography: typography,
      spacing: spacing,
      extend: {
        ...(overrides.theme?.extend || {})
      }
    },
    plugins: [
      require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
      require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
      // Custom plugins
      ...(overrides.plugins || [])
    ]
  };
};
```

### 2. Document Component Usage

Create comprehensive documentation explaining:

- How to install and use the configuration
- Available theme variables and how to use them
- Component styling patterns and best practices
- Customization options for service-specific needs

This documentation should be included in the package README and also added to the central documentation repository.

### 3. Integration Examples

Create example configurations for different types of services:

- Next.js application
- Express API with documentation UI
- React component library

Each example should demonstrate proper integration of the Tailwind config.

## Detailed Tasks & Timeline

| Task | Description | Owner | Sequence |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Create Package Structure** | Set up the repository, initial files, and build process | UI Lead | Step 1 (Phase 2, Day 1) |
| **Extract Theme Variables** | Move colors, typography, spacing from UI-Service | UI Dev | Step 2 (Phase 2, Day 2) |
| **Create Base Configuration** | Implement core Tailwind config with extension points | UI Dev | Step 3 (Phase 2, Day 3) |
| **Add Plugin Support** | Integrate standard plugins and custom component styles | UI Dev | Step 4 (Phase 2, Day 4) |
| **Write Documentation** | Create comprehensive usage docs with examples | Tech Writer | Step 5 (Phase 2, Day 5) |
| **Create Integration Examples** | Build example implementations for different use cases | UI Dev | Step 6 (Phase 2, Day 7) |
| **Package & Publish** | Publish package to internal NPM registry | DevOps | Step 7 (Phase 2, Day 8) |
| **Update UI-Service** | Migrate UI-Service to use the new package | UI Lead | Step 8 (Phase 2, Day 10) |
| **Support Other Teams** | Provide guidance to other teams integrating the package | UI Team | Ongoing (Phase 3) |

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Ensure the extracted configuration maintains visual consistency
   - Document any breaking changes and provide migration guidance

2. **Customization Support**
   - Allow services to extend the configuration for specific needs
   - Provide clear guidelines on what should/shouldn't be customized

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize the configuration for build performance
   - Provide guidance on PurgeCSS usage

4. **Testing**
   - Include visual regression tests
   - Test with multiple service types
   - Validate integration with existing components

## Deliverables

1. The `@smarter-firms/tailwind-config` package published to our internal registry
2. Comprehensive documentation in Markdown format
3. Integration examples for different service types
4. Updated UI-Service using the package
5. Support plan for other teams' adoption

## Success Criteria

- Package successfully published and documented
- UI-Service fully migrated to use the package
- At least two other services successfully integrated
- No visual regressions in existing UI components
- Positive feedback from other service teams

## AI Agent Instructions

```
You are a UI developer responsible for extracting the Tailwind CSS configuration into a standalone package.

CONTEXT:
- The UI-Service contains the current Tailwind configuration
- Multiple services need to share this configuration
- We need to maintain consistency while allowing controlled customization
- Documentation is critical for adoption

TASKS:
1. Analyze the current Tailwind configuration in UI-Service
2. Extract core theme elements (colors, typography, spacing)
3. Create a shareable package structure
4. Build extension points for service-specific needs
5. Implement examples for different service types
6. Document usage patterns and best practices

The configuration should follow modern JavaScript practices, be well-typed, and include comprehensive documentation.
```

## Communication Plan

- Daily standups to report progress
- Technical demo at the midpoint (Phase 2, Day 5)
- Office hours for other teams during Phase 3
- Final review meeting at the end of Phase 3

## Dependencies

- Access to UI-Service repository
- Permission to create new package in registry
- Coordination with at least two other services for testing

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Visual inconsistencies | High | Comprehensive visual testing; phased rollout |
| Integration challenges | Medium | Provide detailed examples; offer direct support |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Optimize package size; provide PurgeCSS guidance |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Prioritize core functionality; allow for extension period |
