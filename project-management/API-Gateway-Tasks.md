# API Gateway Standardization Tasks

## Overview

The API Gateway team is responsible for establishing standardized patterns for service discovery, API design, and cross-service authentication. This document outlines the specific tasks, technical approach, and timeline for implementation of these standards.

## Primary Objectives

1. Define and document API standards for all microservices
2. Implement consistent authentication and authorization flows
3. Configure service discovery integration with infrastructure
4. Create reference implementations and validation tools

## Technical Approach

### 1. API Standards Documentation

Develop comprehensive API standards documentation covering:

```

│   ├── JSON Structure
│   ├── Error Handling
│   ├── Pagination
│   └── Filtering/Sorting
├── URL Patterns
│   ├── Resource Naming
│   ├── Versioning Strategy
│   ├── Query Parameters
│   └── HTTP Methods Usage
├── Security
│   ├── Authentication Headers
│   ├── Authorization Patterns
│   ├── Rate Limiting
│   └── Input Validation
├── Performance
│   ├── Caching Directives
│   ├── Compression
│   ├── Request Timeouts
│   └── Batch Operations
└── Documentation
    ├── OpenAPI Specification
    ├── Required Metadata
    ├── Examples
    └── Changelog Requirements
```

### 2. Authentication & Authorization Framework

Implement a standardized authentication and authorization framework:

- Configure JWT-based authentication
- Implement role-based access control
- Set up token validation and refresh mechanisms
- Document security headers and patterns

### 3. Service Discovery Integration

Work with the Infrastructure team to implement service discovery:

- Configure API Gateway routes to services
- Document service registration patterns
- Implement health check integration
- Create service dependency documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Consistency**
   - Ensure consistent patterns across all services
   - Document exceptions and special cases
   - Provide clear migration guidance for existing services

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Prioritize easy-to-understand patterns
   - Create helpful error messages and guidance
   - Provide client libraries or helpers when possible

3. **Security**
   - Follow OWASP API security best practices
   - Implement defense-in-depth strategies
   - Document security considerations

4. **Performance**
   - Configure appropriate timeouts and limits
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Document performance expectations

## Deliverables

1. Comprehensive API Standards documentation
2. Authentication and authorization framework
3. Service discovery integration with infrastructure
4. OpenAPI specification templates
5. API validation tools and linters
6. Reference implementation
7. Support documentation for service teams

## API Standards Outline

The API standards should include the following key elements:

### Request/Response Format

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Primary response data
  },
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "currentPage": 1,
      "pageSize": 25,
      "totalPages": 10,
      "totalItems": 243
    },
    "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890",
    "timestamp": "2023-07-01T12:34:56Z"
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "/api/v1/resources?page=1&limit=25",
    "next": "/api/v1/resources?page=2&limit=25",
    "previous": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
      "message": "The request contains invalid parameters",
      "detail": "Field 'email' must be a valid email address",
      "path": "user.email",
      "timestamp": "2023-07-01T12:34:56Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### URL Pattern Standards

- Resource naming: plural nouns (`/users` not `/user`)
- API versioning: `/api/v1/resource`
- Query parameters: `?filter=value&sort=field:asc`
- Hierarchical resources: `/api/v1/users/{userId}/orders`

### HTTP Methods

- `GET`: Retrieve resources (never modify state)
- `POST`: Create new resources
- `PUT`: Replace resources completely
- `PATCH`: Update resources partially
- `DELETE`: Remove resources

## Success Criteria

- All services adhere to documented API standards
- Authentication flows work consistently across services
- Services can be discovered and accessed through the API Gateway
- Developers report positive experience with the standards
- Documentation is clear, comprehensive, and accessible

## AI Agent Instructions

```
You are an API architect responsible for establishing API standards and configuring the API Gateway for microservices.

CONTEXT:
- We have multiple microservices that need consistent API patterns
- Authentication and authorization must be standardized
- Service discovery needs to be implemented
- Developer experience is a priority

TASKS:
1. Define comprehensive API standards
2. Configure authentication and authorization flows
3. Integrate with service discovery
4. Create validation tools and templates
5. Document all patterns with examples

The standards should follow RESTful best practices, include proper error handling, and provide a consistent experience across all services.
```

## Communication Plan

- Weekly API working group meetings
- Technical review at the midpoint (July 15)
- Office hours for service teams starting July 17
- Final review and presentation on July 22

## Dependencies

- Coordination with UI Service team for frontend integration
- Integration with Infrastructure team for service discovery
- Security team review of authentication patterns
- Input from all service teams on API needs

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Inconsistent implementation** | High | Create validation tools; provide reference implementations |
| **Authentication complexity** | High | Start with simple patterns; document extensively |
| **Performance bottlenecks** | Medium | Performance test early; implement caching |
| **Developer resistance** | Medium | Focus on developer experience; provide clear benefits |
| **Integration challenges** | Medium | Start with simple service integrations first
