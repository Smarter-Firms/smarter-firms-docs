# Service Teams Standardization Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines the required tasks for all service teams to integrate with the standardized components being developed by the UI-Service, Infrastructure, and API Gateway teams. Completing these tasks will ensure consistent styling, streamlined deployment, and proper service integration across the platform.

## Required Actions for All Service Teams

Each service team must complete the following actions during the standardization period:

1. **UI & Styling Integration**
2. **AWS Development Environment Integration**
3. **API Standards Compliance**
4. **Testing and Verification**

## Timeline

| Phase | Dates | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Preparation** | July 1-15, 2023 | Review standards, plan integration work |
| **Implementation** | July 16-22, 2023 | Implement required changes |
| **Verification** | July 23-27, 2023 | Test and verify compliance |
| **Reporting** | July 28-30, 2023 | Report status and resolve issues |

## Detailed Tasks by Category

### 1. UI & Styling Integration

| Task | Description | Priority | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Tailwind Package Adoption** | Update your service to use the centralized Tailwind package | High | July 16-18 |

| **Visual Testing** | Verify visual consistency | Medium | July 20-22 |

#### Implementation Steps

1. Replace your local `tailwind.config.js` with a reference to the shared package:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
const sharedConfig = require('@smarter-firms/tailwind-config');

module.exports = sharedConfig({
  // Service-specific overrides (if allowed)
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    // Add your service-specific content paths
  ]
});
```

2. Update any hardcoded color values or styling to use theme variables
3. Verify component appearance matches the design system
4. Report any issues or special needs to the UI-Service team

### 2. AWS Development Environment Integration

| Task | Description | Priority | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **CI/CD Pipeline Setup** | Configure your service's deployment pipeline | High | July 16-19 |
| **Environment Configuration** | Update environment variables and secrets | High | July 17-19 |
| **Service Registration** | Register with service discovery | High | July 19-21 |
| **Integration Testing** | Verify proper deployment and operation | High | July 22-24 |

#### Implementation Steps

1. Implement the provided GitHub Actions workflow template:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-to-dev.yml
name: Deploy to Dev Environment

on:
  push:
    branches: [ dev, feature/* ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      # Add the standard deployment steps (provided by Infrastructure team)
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-2
          
      # Additional standard steps will be provided
```

2. Update environment configuration to use AWS Secrets Manager
3. Register your service with the service discovery mechanism
4. Perform integration tests to verify proper operation

### 3. API Standards Compliance

| Task | Description | Priority | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **API Audit** | Review existing APIs for compliance | High | July 16-18 |
| **Standards Implementation** | Update APIs to follow standards | High | July 18-21 |
| **OpenAPI Documentation** | Create/update OpenAPI specifications | Medium | July 19-22 |
| **Authentication Integration** | Implement standardized auth flows | High | July 20-23 |

#### Implementation Steps

1. Review your API endpoints against the standards document
2. Update request/response formats to match the standard:

```typescript
// Example response format
interface StandardResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  meta: {
    pagination?: {
      currentPage: number;
      pageSize: number;
      totalPages: number;
      totalItems: number;
    };
    requestId: string;
    timestamp: string;
  };
  links?: {
    self: string;
    next?: string;
    previous?: string;
  };
  errors?: Array<{
    code: string;
    message: string;
    detail?: string;
    path?: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }>;
}
```

3. Create or update OpenAPI specifications
4. Integrate with the standardized authentication flow

### 4. Testing and Verification

| Task | Description | Priority | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Integration Testing** | Test service with other services | High | July 22-25 |
| **UI Verification** | Verify visual consistency | Medium | July 22-24 |
| **Performance Testing** | Verify performance meets standards | Medium | July 23-26 |

2. Verify UI components render correctly
3. Perform performance testing against defined metrics
4. Update documentation to reflect changes

## AI Agent Instructions for Service Teams

```
You are a full-stack developer responsible for updating a microservice to comply with new standardization requirements.

CONTEXT:
- The service needs to adopt a centralized Tailwind configuration
- Deployment must be configured for the AWS development environment
- APIs must follow the new standards documentation
- Integration with other services must be verified

TASKS:
1. Update the Tailwind configuration to use the shared package
2. Configure the deployment pipeline for AWS
3. Update API endpoints to follow the standards
4. Create/update integration tests
5. Verify compliance with all standards

Follow the detailed instructions in the Service-Teams-Tasks.md document and consult with the core teams if you encounter issues.
```
