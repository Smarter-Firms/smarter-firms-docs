# Infrastructure Team Standardization Tasks

## Overview

The Infrastructure team is responsible for establishing a standardized AWS development environment that enables consistent deployment, testing, and integration of all microservices. This document outlines the specific tasks, technical approach, and timeline for implementation.

## Primary Objectives

1. Provision AWS development environment infrastructure
2. Configure deployment pipelines for all services
3. Implement service discovery mechanisms
4. Document access patterns and usage guidelines

## Technical Approach

### 1. AWS Environment Architecture

Create a dedicated development environment with the following components:

```
AWS Development Environment
├── Networking
│   ├── VPC
│   ├── Subnets (Public/Private)
│   ├── Security Groups
│   └── Load Balancers
├── Compute
│   ├── ECS Clusters
│   ├── EKS Cluster (optional)
│   └── EC2 Management Instances
├── Database
│   ├── RDS Instances
│   └── ElastiCache Clusters
├── Storage
│   ├── S3 Buckets
│   └── EFS Volumes
├── Monitoring
│   ├── CloudWatch
│   ├── X-Ray
│   └── Grafana/Prometheus
└── CI/CD
    ├── CodePipeline
    ├── CodeBuild
    └── ECR Repositories
```

### 2. Service Deployment Framework

Implement a standardized deployment mechanism that each service can use:

- Create a template GitHub Actions workflow for service deployment
- Configure AWS CodePipeline for each service
- Establish standardized environment variables
- Implement secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager

### 3. Service Discovery & Registry

Implement a service discovery mechanism to allow services to locate and communicate with each other:

- Use AWS Cloud Map or an equivalent solution
- Configure DNS-based service discovery
- Document service endpoint patterns
- Implement health checks and circuit breakers

## Detailed Tasks & Timeline

| Task | Description | Owner | Sequence |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **VPC & Network Setup** | Configure core networking infrastructure | Network Engineer | Step 1 (Phase 2, Day 1) |
| **Database Provisioning** | Set up shared and service-specific databases | Database Engineer | Step 2 (Phase 2, Day 2) |
| **Container Registry** | Configure ECR repositories for all services | DevOps Engineer | Step 3 (Phase 2, Day 3) |
| **Deployment Pipelines** | Create standardized CI/CD pipelines | DevOps Lead | Step 4 (Phase 2, Day 5) |
| **Service Discovery** | Implement service discovery framework | Systems Architect | Step 5 (Phase 2, Day 7) |
| **Monitoring Setup** | Configure logging and monitoring | SRE Engineer | Step 6 (Phase 2, Day 8) |
| **Access Management** | Configure IAM roles and access patterns | Security Engineer | Step 7 (Phase 2, Day 9) |
| **Documentation** | Create comprehensive environment documentation | Tech Writer | Step 8 (Phase 2, Day 10) |
| **Team Onboarding** | Assist teams with pipeline integration | DevOps Team | Ongoing (Phase 3) |

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Security First**
   - Follow AWS security best practices
   - Implement least privilege access control
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
   - Keep environment variables and secrets secure

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - Right-size resources for development purposes
   - Implement auto-scaling for cost control
   - Configure resource tagging for cost tracking
   - Set up budget alerts and monitoring

3. **Consistency**
   - Use infrastructure as code (Terraform or CloudFormation)
   - Standardize naming conventions
   - Document all configuration decisions
   - Create reusable templates for service deployment

4. **Observability**
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Configure service metrics
   - Set up alerting for critical issues
   - Provide dashboard access to all teams

## Deliverables

1. Fully provisioned AWS development environment
2. Deployment pipeline templates for each service type
3. Service discovery mechanism
4. Documentation on environment access and usage
5. Runbooks for common operations
6. Cost monitoring and optimization tools

## Required AWS Resources

| Resource Type | Purpose | Specifications |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **VPC** | Network isolation | CIDR block, subnets, routing tables |
| **ECS Clusters** | Container hosting | 2 clusters (frontend, backend) |
| **RDS** | Relational databases | PostgreSQL instances, proper sizing |
| **ElastiCache** | Caching layer | Redis cluster |
| **S3** | Object storage | Versioning enabled, lifecycle policies |
| **CloudWatch** | Monitoring | Logs, metrics, dashboards |
| **EC2** | Management/bastion | t3.micro instances, secure access |
| **ALB/NLB** | Load balancing | Routing rules, health checks |
| **IAM** | Access control | Roles, policies, group definitions |
| **ECR** | Container registry | One repository per service |
| **Secrets Manager** | Credentials storage | Encrypted storage for service secrets |

## AWS Credentials Requirements

The Infrastructure team will need the following AWS credentials to set up the environment:

- **Account ID**: The AWS account ID for the development environment
- **IAM User**: Administrator-level access to provision resources
- **Access Key/Secret Key**: For programmatic access
- **Console Access**: For manual configurations and verification

These credentials should be provided securely and managed according to company security policies.

## Success Criteria

- All services can be deployed to the environment
- Services can discover and communicate with each other
- Monitoring is configured and accessible
- Documentation is complete and comprehensive
- Teams are successfully onboarded to the environment

## AI Agent Instructions

```
You are a DevOps engineer responsible for provisioning and configuring the AWS development environment.

CONTEXT:
- We need a standardized environment for testing microservices
- Services need to discover and communicate with each other
- Deployment should be automated and consistent
- Security and cost optimization are priorities

TASKS:
1. Provision core AWS infrastructure (VPC, subnets, etc.)
2. Configure container hosting environments
3. Set up database resources with proper security
4. Implement service discovery mechanisms
5. Configure monitoring and logging
6. Document access patterns and usage guidelines

Use infrastructure as code (Terraform preferred) and document all decisions. Follow AWS best practices for security and cost optimization.
```

## Communication Plan

- Daily standups to report progress
- Technical review at the midpoint (Phase 2, Day 5)
- Office hours for service teams starting in Phase 3
- Final environment review at the end of Phase 3

## Dependencies

- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Budget approval for resources
- Coordination with security team
- Service deployment requirements from all teams

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Security vulnerabilities** | High | Security review at key milestones; follow AWS best practices |
| **Cost overruns** | Medium | Implement budget alerts; right-size resources; schedule non-critical resource shutdown |
| **Integration failures** | Medium | Start with simple service examples; incremental complexity |
| **Timeline slippage** | Medium | Prioritize core infrastructure; create phased approach |
| **Knowledge gaps** | Medium | Document extensively; conduct knowledge sharing sessions |
