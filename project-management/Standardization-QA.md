# Standardization Initiative: Centralized Questions & Answers

## Overview

This document compiles questions from the UI-Service, Infrastructure, and API-Gateway teams regarding the standardization initiative and provides consolidated answers. All teams should reference this document to ensure consistent implementation approach across services.

## Documentation Standards & Process

### Q: What is the timeline for moving current work-in-progress documentation to the central repository?
**A:** Documentation should be finalized and moved to the central repository by the end of Phase 2. Any documentation that directly supports implementation work should be prioritized. Each team should submit PRs to the central repository once documentation has been peer-reviewed and meets the quality standards outlined in our documentation guidelines.

### Q: Should we prioritize moving existing documentation to the central repository immediately, or complete additional peer review first?
**A:** Complete peer review first. All documentation should go through at least one technical review and one readability review before being submitted to the central repository. This ensures consistency and accuracy across all documentation.

### Q: What constitutes "stable" vs. "work-in-progress" documentation?
**A:** Stable documentation describes implemented features that are unlikely to change significantly and have been validated through testing. Work-in-progress documentation covers features still under development or subject to significant revision. Only stable documentation should be moved to the central repository.

## Security Requirements & Review Process

### Q: Should we implement a formal security review process before finalizing the standardization implementation?
**A:** Yes. Each team should conduct an internal security review during Phase 3, followed by a cross-team security review before the end of Phase 4. For critical security components, an additional review with the Project Management Office is recommended.

### Q: Is the geographic anomaly detection system expected to block suspicious logins automatically, or should it only generate alerts initially?
**A:** Initially, the system should only generate alerts for suspicious activities. Once we have established a baseline of normal behavior and tuned the detection parameters (approximately 2-3 weeks after deployment), we can enable automatic blocking. This phased approach minimizes the risk of blocking legitimate users.

### Q: Are there specific security compliance requirements that need to be addressed?
**A:** All implementations must comply with OWASP security guidelines and standard practices for authentication and authorization. Additionally, ensure PII is handled according to our data protection standards with proper encryption and access controls. Full compliance with SOC 2 Type II requirements is necessary.

## Performance Expectations & Metrics

### Q: Are there specific performance metrics we should target for the enhanced authentication middleware?
**A:** Authentication middleware should add no more than 50ms to request latency under normal operating conditions. Token validation should be optimized through caching and efficient validation algorithms. Load testing should demonstrate that the system can handle at least 100 requests per second with authentication enabled.

### Q: What metrics should we use to measure the success of our standardization efforts?
**A:** Success metrics include:
- Reduction in authentication-related issues (target: 80% reduction)
- Consistent response times across services (target: < 100ms variance)
- Adoption rate of standardized components (target: 100% by end of Phase 4)
- Code duplication reduction (target: 90% reduction in authentication/security code)
- Developer satisfaction with authentication flows (measured through surveys)

### Q: What are the performance expectations for the AWS development environment?
**A:** The development environment should be optimized for developer experience rather than maximum performance. However, it should still provide response times within 2x of production for typical operations to ensure realistic testing.

## Implementation Priorities & Timelines

### Q: What is the timeline for completing the remaining standardization tasks?
**A:** The standardization initiative follows a 4-phase approach:
- Phase 1 (Week 1): Planning and documentation
- Phase 2 (Week 2): Core implementation by infrastructure teams
- Phase 3 (Week 3): Service integration with standards
- Phase 4 (Week 4): Testing, verification, and refinement

Each team should complete their core implementation work by the end of Phase 2, with refinements and service integration continuing through Phases 3 and 4.

### Q: Should we prioritize consistency with existing production environment or build a more optimized dev environment?
**A:** Prioritize consistency with production where it impacts testing validity (service discovery, authentication flows, etc.). However, the development environment can be optimized for cost and developer experience in other areas (e.g., scaled-down resources, simplified networking). Document any significant differences between environments.

## Integration & Cross-Service Coordination

### Q: Is there a centralized testing strategy for cross-service authentication flows?
**A:** Yes. We will implement integration tests that verify the end-to-end authentication flow across services. These tests will be maintained in the central repository and run against the development environment. Each service should also implement unit tests for their authentication components and integration tests for direct dependencies.

### Q: Should the enhanced authentication middleware include additional support for service-to-service authentication beyond the internal rate limiting tier?
**A:** Yes. The authentication middleware should support both user-facing authentication and service-to-service authentication. Service-to-service authentication should use JWT with audience validation specific to the target service. Additionally, implement IP-based restrictions for internal services and rotating service credentials.

### Q: Are there specific integration requirements from other service teams that might affect infrastructure design?
**A:** Several key integration requirements have been identified:
- The Data Service requires direct database access for analytics workloads
- The Notifications Service needs SQS integration for asynchronous message processing
- The Dashboard Application requires WebSocket support
- All services need centralized logging with service-specific filters

## Environment Configuration & Resources

### Q: What is the expected scale of the development environment?
**A:** The development environment should support concurrent deployment of all 13 microservices with approximately 25% of production load capacity. It should allow for 10-15 concurrent developers working across different services with minimal interference.

### Q: What is the budget allocation for this development environment?
**A:** The monthly budget for the development environment is $2,500. This includes all AWS services required for running the environment. Optimize for cost where possible, including scheduling automated shutdowns of non-critical resources during off-hours.

### Q: Do we have all necessary AWS credentials with appropriate permissions?
**A:** AWS credentials will be provided to the Infrastructure team lead by Phase 1, Day 3. These credentials will have administrator access to the development AWS account. The Infrastructure team will then create appropriate IAM roles with least-privilege permissions for each service team.

### Q: Is there a preference between AWS ECS vs. EKS for container orchestration?
**A:** Use ECS for the development environment. This aligns with our production environment and requires less overhead to maintain. However, the infrastructure should be designed with service abstraction in mind to enable potential migration to EKS in the future if needed.

## Next Steps

1. Each team should review this Q&A document and incorporate the guidance into their implementation plans
2. The Infrastructure team should begin setting up the core AWS resources as outlined in their tasks
3. The API-Gateway team should continue their work on authentication standardization with the clarifications provided
4. The UI-Service team should focus on finalizing their documentation and component standardization
5. All teams should schedule a mid-Phase 2 sync meeting to ensure alignment
6. Submit any additional questions to the Project Management Office for inclusion in this document
