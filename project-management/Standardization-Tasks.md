# Standardization Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines critical standardization tasks required to improve development efficiency, ensure UI consistency, and enable proper integration testing. These standardizations will establish a foundation for the next phase of development as we move toward a cohesive product experience.

## Key Objectives

1. **Establish UI/UX Consistency**: Create a single source of truth for UI components and styling
2. **Streamline AWS Development Environment**: Configure a shared testing environment for integration 
3. **Standardize Testing Approaches**: Establish consistent patterns for unit, integration, and E2E testing
4. **Create Service Registry**: Define how services discover and communicate with each other

## Timeline

| Phase | Sequence | Focus | 
|-------|----------|-------|
| Planning | Phase 1 (Week 1) | Define standards and document requirements |
| Implementation | Phase 2 (Week 2) | Teams implement core standards |
| Integration | Phase 3 (Week 3) | Cross-service testing and verification |
| Refinement | Phase 4 (Week 4) | Address issues and document learnings |

## Critical Path Items

1. **UI-Service Tailwind Configuration Extraction**
   - Extract configuration to separate package
   - Document theming variables and usage patterns
   - Create integration examples for other services

2. **AWS Development Environment Configuration**
   - Provision shared infrastructure components
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines for all services
   - Document deployment patterns

3. **API Gateway Integration**
   - Establish service routing standards
   - Configure authentication flow across services
   - Document API versioning approach

## Team Assignments

### UI-Service Team

| Task | Priority | Sequence | 
|------|----------|----------|
| Extract Tailwind Config to NPM Package | High | Step 1 (Phase 2) |
| Document Component Usage | High | Step 2 (Phase 2) |
| Create Theme Integration Examples | Medium | Step 3 (Phase 2) |
| Update UI-Service to use package | Medium | Step 4 (Phase 3) |

### Infrastructure Team

| Task | Priority | Sequence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Provision AWS Dev Environment | High | Step 1 (Phase 2) |
| Configure Service Registration | High | Step 2 (Phase 2) |
| Create Deployment Pipelines | Medium | Step 3 (Phase 2) |
| Document AWS Environment Access | Medium | Step 1 (Phase 2) |

### API Gateway Team

| Task | Priority | Sequence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Document API Standards | High | Step 1 (Phase 2) |
| Configure Cross-Service Auth | High | Step 2 (Phase 2) |
| Implement Service Discovery | Medium | Step 3 (Phase 3) |
| Create API Validation Tests | Medium | Step 4 (Phase 3) |

## Other Service Teams

Each service team will need to integrate with the standardized components:

1. Update to use common Tailwind configuration
2. Configure CI/CD for AWS dev environment
3. Adopt standardized testing patterns
4. Document service APIs following standards

## Success Criteria

- All services use the centralized Tailwind configuration
- Automated deployments to AWS dev environment working for all services
- Integration tests passing across service boundaries
- Teams able to efficiently test changes across the platform

## Next Steps

1. Schedule standardization kickoff meeting
2. Distribute tasks to respective teams
3. Set up tracking mechanism for standardization progress
4. Review first milestone achievements after Phase 2 completion
