# Authentication API Feedback

This document provides UI-focused feedback on the Auth Service API contracts and recommendations for improvement.

## API Gap Analysis

Below are identified gaps in the current API endpoints that would enhance the user experience:

| Endpoint | UI Gap/Recommendation |
|----------|------------------------|
| `/api/auth/clio/authorize` | Need clear error handling for authorization failures (e.g., user denied access, API rate limiting, service unavailable) |
| `/api/auth/clio/callback` | Should include loading state handling and clear messaging during token exchange |
| `/api/auth/login` | Add support for "Remember Me" functionality |
| `/api/auth/register` | Add endpoint for checking email/username availability before form submission |
| `/api/auth/logout` | Add support for multi-device logout option |
| `/api/auth/me` | Support for partial profile updates rather than requiring a full profile object |
| `/api/auth/2fa/verify` | Implement "remember this device" functionality to reduce 2FA friction |

## Suggested New Endpoints

The following new endpoints would improve the authentication flows:

```
GET    /api/auth/email-check?email={email} // Check if email exists/is available
POST   /api/auth/verify-password           // Verify current password before sensitive operations
POST   /api/auth/devices                   // List active sessions/devices
DELETE /api/auth/devices/{deviceId}        // Revoke specific device session
POST   /api/auth/2fa/remember-device       // Add current device to trusted devices list
GET    /api/auth/2fa/status                // Check if 2FA is enabled and which method
```

## User Flow Improvements

### Login Flow

The current login flow could be improved by:

1. Implementing progressive loading during Clio SSO authentication
2. Adding "magic link" email authentication as an alternative option
3. Providing clear error messages for specific authentication failures
4. Supporting passwordless authentication options

### Registration Flow

The registration process would benefit from:

1. Real-time email validation and availability checking
2. Streamlined multi-step form to reduce cognitive load
3. Clear password strength indicators
4. Option to use Clio SSO during initial registration

### Account Management

The account management experience would be enhanced by:

1. Adding session/device management with revocation capabilities
2. Implementing connected accounts dashboard (Clio and potential future integrations)
3. Providing security event log for transparency
4. Supporting user-initiated account deletion with confirmation

## Error Handling Recommendations

Current error responses could be improved by:

1. Providing machine-readable error codes alongside human-readable messages
2. Including field-specific validation errors in a consistent format
3. Offering suggested actions with error messages
4. Implementing retry strategies for transient errors

Example improved error response:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
  "message": "The email or password you entered is incorrect",
  "details": {
    "fields": {
      "email": null,
      "password": "Invalid password"
    }
  },
  "suggestions": [
    "Try resetting your password",
    "Check if Caps Lock is on"
  ]
}
```

## Token Management Recommendations

For improved security and user experience:

1. Use HTTP-only cookies for token storage to prevent XSS attacks
2. Implement short-lived access tokens (15 min) with longer refresh tokens (7 days)
3. Add token rotation on refresh for improved security
4. Include user agent/device fingerprinting for suspicious login detection
5. Support access token invalidation when permissions change

## Security Enhancement Recommendations

Additional security measures to consider:

1. Implement rate limiting for all authentication endpoints
2. Add support for WebAuthn/FIDO2 for stronger authentication
3. Enhance logging for security-related events
4. Implement progressive security challenges for high-risk actions
5. Add login notifications for unusual activities

## UI/UX Integration Points

The frontend requires additional API capabilities:

1. Clear loading states for all authentication processes
2. Consistent error handling patterns
3. Support for gradual user data collection
4. Session timeout warnings with automatic extension options
5. Integration with browser credential managers

## Implementation Priority

Recommended implementation priority for improvements:

1. **Critical**
   - Comprehensive error handling for better user feedback
   - HTTP-only cookie implementation for token storage
   - Email availability checking endpoint

2. **High**
   - 2FA "remember device" functionality
   - Progressive loading states
   - Session management endpoints

3. **Medium**
   - Multi-device logout capabilities
   - Enhanced security event logging
   - Password strength validation enhancement

4. **Nice to have**
   - WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
   - Magic link authentication
   - Connected accounts dashboard
