# Dashboard Application Architecture

The Dashboard Application is the primary interface for users of the Smarter Firms platform. It provides data visualization, reporting, client management, and access to all platform features. This document provides an overview of the architecture and design decisions for the Dashboard Application.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom component library built on TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state and React Query for server state
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js with React-Chartjs-2 wrapper
- **API Integration**: Axios for RESTful endpoints via API Gateway
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom design system
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication with cookies

## Architecture Overview

The Dashboard Application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Component Reusability**: Components are designed to be reusable across the application, with clear interfaces and props.
2. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript typing is enforced throughout the application to prevent runtime errors.
3. **Responsive Design**: All UI components are responsive and work well on all device sizes.
4. **Accessibility**: The application follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
5. **Performance**: Data fetching optimizations using React Query with caching strategies.
6. **Security**: Role-based access control for features and API endpoints.

## Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials on the login screen
2. Credentials are sent to the Auth Service via API Gateway
3. On successful authentication, a JWT token is returned and stored in a secure HTTP-only cookie
4. The token is included in all subsequent API requests
5. Token refresh is handled automatically before expiration

## Data Flow

1. API requests are made through service modules which abstract the API endpoints
2. React Query is used to fetch, cache, and synchronize server state
3. Global application state is managed with React Context API
4. Component-specific state is managed with React useState and useReducer hooks

## Integration Points

The Dashboard Application integrates with several backend services:

1. **Auth Service**: User authentication and authorization
2. **Data Service**: Analytics, reporting, and data management
3. **Notifications Service**: Real-time and in-app notifications
4. **Clio Integration Service**: Synchronization with Clio data
5. **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all backend services

## Performance Considerations

1. Code splitting via Next.js dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle size
2. Image optimization with Next.js Image component
3. Server-side rendering for initial page load performance
4. Caching strategies for API requests using React Query
5. Lazy loading of components and data

## Security Measures

1. JWT-based authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies
2. CSRF protection
3. Role-based access control
4. Input validation on all user inputs
5. Content Security Policy
6. Regular security audits

## Error Handling

1. Consistent error handling across all API requests
2. User-friendly error messages with appropriate recovery actions
3. Error boundaries to prevent application crashes
4. Detailed error logging for debugging

## Future Enhancements

1. Implementation of WebSockets for real-time updates
2. Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
3. Advanced analytics with machine learning insights
4. Enhanced data visualization options
5. Direct document editing capabilities
