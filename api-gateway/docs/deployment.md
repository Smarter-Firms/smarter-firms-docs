# Deployment Documentation

This document outlines the requirements and considerations for deploying the API Gateway to production environments.

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

| Component | Specification | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| CPU | 2 vCPUs | 4+ vCPUs recommended for high traffic |
| Memory | 2 GB RAM | 4+ GB RAM recommended for caching |
| Storage | 20 GB SSD | Primarily for logs and application |
| Network | 100 Mbps | 1 Gbps recommended for high traffic |

### Dependencies

| Service | Version | Purpose | High Availability |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Node.js | v16+ | Runtime | N/A |
| Redis | v5+ | Caching, Service Registry | Redis Cluster or Sentinel |
| Database | PostgreSQL 12+ | Optional - metrics storage | Primary/Replica setup |
| Load Balancer | Any | Traffic distribution | Required |

### Cloud Provider Recommendations

#### AWS

- **Compute**: ECS Fargate or EKS
- **Caching/Registry**: ElastiCache Redis (cluster mode)
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer
- **Auto Scaling**: ECS Service Auto Scaling or EC2 Auto Scaling
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + X-Ray

#### Azure

- **Compute**: AKS or App Service
- **Caching/Registry**: Azure Cache for Redis
- **Load Balancing**: Azure Application Gateway
- **Auto Scaling**: Azure Autoscale
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor + Application Insights

#### Google Cloud

- **Compute**: GKE or Cloud Run
- **Caching/Registry**: Memorystore for Redis
- **Load Balancing**: Cloud Load Balancing
- **Auto Scaling**: GKE Autoscaler or Instance Groups
- **Monitoring**: Cloud Monitoring + Cloud Trace

### Docker Deployment

The API Gateway can be containerized using the provided Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD node healthcheck.js

CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

The API Gateway is designed for horizontal scaling with these considerations:

1. **Stateless Design**: Each instance can operate independently
2. **Redis Dependency**: All instances must connect to the same Redis instance/cluster
3. **Load Balancing**: Use sticky sessions if websocket connections are used

#### Recommended Scaling Metrics:

- CPU Utilization: 70-80%
- Memory Utilization: 70-80%
- Request Rate: > 500 req/sec per instance
- Response Time: > 200ms average

### Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling may be preferred in these scenarios:

1. **Heavy Caching**: Increase memory for larger cache sizes
2. **Complex Transformations**: Increase CPU for request/response transformations
3. **Development/Testing**: Simplify infrastructure

## Networking

### Ingress Traffic

- Terminate SSL/TLS at the load balancer
- Route all API traffic to the Gateway on port 3000
- Configure health checks using `/health` endpoint

### Service Communication

- Use internal networking when possible between Gateway and services
- Ensure firewall rules allow Gateway to reach all services
- Use secure communication (TLS) between Gateway and external services

### Network Security

- Implement rate limiting at the network level
- Set up WAF rules for common web attacks
- Use private subnets for Gateway instances
- Implement network segmentation between services

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Threshold | Alert Priority |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Request Rate | Requests per second | Varies by environment | Low |
| Error Rate | Percentage of 4xx/5xx responses | >5% | High |
| Response Time | Average/p95/p99 latency | >500ms avg | Medium |
| CPU Usage | Average CPU utilization | >85% | Medium |
| Memory Usage | Average memory utilization | >85% | Medium |
| Cache Hit Ratio | Percentage of cache hits | <70% | Low |
| Circuit Breaker Trips | Count of circuit breaker trips | >0 | Medium |
| Health Check Failures | Count of service health check failures | >0 | High |

### Logging

Configure structured logging with these fields:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-06-07T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Request processed",
  "service": "api-gateway",
  "requestId": "req-123",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/api/v1/users",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "responseTime": 45,
  "userId": "user-456",
  "clientIp": "10.0.0.1",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "cached": true
}
```

### Alerting

Set up alerts for:

1. Gateway instance health
2. Service health check failures
3. High error rates
4. Unusual traffic patterns
5. Circuit breaker state changes
6. Redis availability
7. High response times

### Dashboards

Create monitoring dashboards for:

1. **Overview**: Key metrics for all gateway instances
2. **Service Health**: Status of all registered services
3. **Caching**: Hit rates, memory usage, evictions
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Status of all circuit breakers
5. **Rate Limiting**: Limit usage and rejections
6. **Errors**: Error rates by service and status code

## Production Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Run load tests simulating expected traffic
- [ ] Configure all environment variables
- [ ] Review security settings (JWT keys, rate limits, etc.)
- [ ] Validate Redis connection and configuration
- [ ] Set up health checks for all services
- [ ] Configure logging and monitoring
- [ ] Review SSL/TLS certificates and security headers
- [ ] Set appropriate cache TTLs for production

### Deployment Process

1. Deploy new version to a staging environment
2. Run integration tests against staging
3. Validate metrics and logs in staging
4. Deploy to production using a blue/green or canary strategy
5. Monitor closely during and after deployment
6. Have rollback plan ready

### Post-Deployment Validation

- [ ] Verify all services register correctly
- [ ] Check authentication and authorization flows
- [ ] Validate caching behavior
- [ ] Confirm circuit breakers function as expected
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Review logs for any unexpected errors
- [ ] Validate metrics are being collected
- [ ] Confirm dashboard visibility

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Disable debug/development modes
- [ ] Ensure all secrets are securely managed
- [ ] Verify JWT signature verification
- [ ] Enable strict CORS settings
- [ ] Set secure HTTP headers
- [ ] Configure rate limits
- [ ] Enable request logging
- [ ] Audit service permissions

## Backup and Recovery

### Redis Backup Strategy

1. Enable Redis persistence (RDB or AOF)
2. Schedule regular RDB snapshots
3. Replicate data to a standby instance
4. Test recovery procedures regularly

### Gateway Backup

1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for all configuration
2. Store configuration in version control
3. Automate deployment process
4. Document manual recovery steps

### Disaster Recovery

1. Deploy across multiple availability zones
2. Maintain standby environment in separate region
3. Create automated failover for Redis
4. Document and practice recovery procedures

## Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Configure appropriate TTLs for different content types
   - Enable compression for large responses
   - Monitor cache hit rates and adjust as needed

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Use connection-based load balancing
   - Consider using service weights for optimal distribution

3. **Network Optimization**:
   - Enable keep-alive connections
   - Configure appropriate timeouts
   - Use connection pooling for backend services

4. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Allocate sufficient memory for Node.js
   - Configure Redis memory limits and policies
   - Use appropriate instance types for workload
