# API Gateway Implementation - Sprint 2 Tasks

## Service Overview
The API Gateway serves as the central entry point for all client requests, managing routing, authentication verification, rate limiting, and providing a unified API interface for the Smarter Firms platform.

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic repository setup complete
- ✅ Environment configuration defined
- ✅ Project structure established

## Implementation Focus
For Sprint 2, we will focus on:
1. Integrating the Auth Service for authentication and authorization
2. Implementing service discovery for resilient microservice communication
3. Setting up core infrastructure for request handling and routing
