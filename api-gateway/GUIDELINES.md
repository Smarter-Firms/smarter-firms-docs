# API Gateway Documentation Guidelines

## Key Documentation Responsibilities

Your team is responsible for maintaining:

1. **Routing Configuration** - Documentation of service routing and middleware
2. **Security Middleware** - Details of authentication and security implementations
3. **Rate Limiting** - Specifications for different rate limiting tiers
4. **Service Discovery** - How services are discovered and registered

## Critical Documents

- `/api-gateway/routing-configuration.md` - Routing patterns and configuration
- `/api-gateway/security-middleware.md` - Auth middleware implementation
- `/api-gateway/rate-limiting.md` - Rate limiting tiers and configuration
- `/api-gateway/service-registration.md` - Service discovery process

## Update Frequency

Update documentation:
- When adding new routing patterns
- After modifying security middleware
- When changing rate limiting configurations
- When updating service discovery mechanisms

Your documentation serves as the integration point for all microservices.
